            "response": "To diagnose an engine misfire, start by using an OBD-II scanner to check for error codes. Inspect the spark plugs for wear or carbon buildup and replace them if necessary. Check the ignition coils and wires for damage. Ensure fuel injectors are clean and working properly. Listen for unusual engine sounds and note any loss of power. If misfiring persists, further diagnosis may require a mechanic.",
            "car_knowledge": "An engine misfire occurs when one or more cylinders fail to ignite properly, leading to rough idling, loss of power, and increased fuel consumption. Common causes include faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel delivery issues, vacuum leaks, or sensor malfunctions. Prolonged misfires can damage the catalytic converter and reduce engine efficiency. Regular maintenance and timely replacement of worn components help prevent misfires.",

            "car_knowledge": "An engine misfire occurs when one or more cylinders fail to ignite properly, leading to rough idling, loss of power, and increased fuel consumption. Common causes include faulty spark plugs, ignition coils, fuel delivery issues, vacuum leaks, or sensor malfunctions. Prolonged misfires can damage the catalytic converter and reduce engine efficiency. Regular maintenance and timely replacement of worn components help prevent misfires.",

Old, dirty oil can lead to sludge buildup, reduced efficiency, and increased wear on engine components. Most vehicles require an oil change every 3,000 to 7,500 miles, depending on the type of oil and driving conditions.
